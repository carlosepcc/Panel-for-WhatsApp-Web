# Panel for WhatsApp™ Web

This firefox extension adds a button next to your address bar that allows you
to access WhatsApp™ Web in a separate panel without interrupting your workflow.
When the panel is closed, a badge on the button informs you about the number of
unread messages, being always in your view without the need to switch tabs.
To get started, log in into WhatsApp™ Web in the way you are used to.
